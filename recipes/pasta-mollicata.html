<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Pasta with breadcrumbs, or pasta mollicata, is a signature dish in the Southern Italian 
    kitchen. Also known as pasta ca' muddica or pasta ammudicata, this simple recipe originated 
    in Italy's cucina povera or peasant kitchen. It's a recipe invented to not only use up 
    stale bread but also to add flavour and bulk to what is a very simple dish.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>14 oz Bucatini or spaghetti (400g)</li>
    <li>2-3 slices country bread semi-stale</li>
    <li>4 anchovy fillets in oil or salted (rinsed)</li>
    <li>2-3 garlic cloves peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>4-5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil.</li>
    <li>salt for pasta and to taste</li>
    <li>fresh parsley chopped (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tsp peperoncino flakes (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Peel and chop the garlic. Rinse and chop the anchovy fillets. Break the
         inside of the bread slices into small pieces.</li>
    <li>Blend the bread pieces in a food processor until you have rough 
        breadcrumbs (not too fine). Fry the breadcrumbs in heated olive 
        oil until they become golden and crispy. Remove the breadcrumbs 
        from the pan. You can add garlic while frying the breadcrumbs to
         make them more garlicky.</li>
    <li>Put a pot of water onto boil for the pasta. Add salt once it starts
         to boil and then cook the pasta al dente according to the 
         instructions on the packet. When the pasta is cooked, save some cooking
          water and drain it.</li>
    <li>While the water is boiling, saut√© the garlic and anchovies in a skillet
         large enough to hold the pasta until the anchovies have melted. Add 
         the drained pasta to the skillet and mix well with the anchovies and garlic.
          If it seems dry, add some pasta cooking water and mix over a low heat for a
           few seconds. The starch in the cooking water will help to make the sauce creamier.</li>
    <li>Add some of the breadcrumbs and mix them into the pasta. 
        Then serve immediately sprinkled with a generous amount of more fried breadcrumbs.</li>
</ol>
